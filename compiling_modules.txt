// there are two ways to build dynamically loadable kernel modules
// In tree module and out of tree module what we are building is out of tree modules
// modules are built using kbuild (kernel build)
// In The top level of kernel we should give
make -C <path to kernel makefile> M=<path to module source> modules
make -C <path to kernel makefile> M=<path to module source> modules_install

// In the driver make file you should provide
obj-m := <module_name>.o // for dynamically loadable modules

// Printk is the kernel's equivalent of printf
// it doesn't support floating point
// use %d for integers, %s for strings
// it uses Different log levels which can be found at <linux/kernel.h>
// this log levels are compared with the console log level and if it's value is less than the console log level, the message will not be printed
